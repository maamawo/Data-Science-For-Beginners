# # Day 2 - Document Q&A with RAG using Chroma
# 
# Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!
# 
# **NOTE**: The Day 1 notebook contains lots of information for getting set up with Kaggle Notebooks. If you are having any issues, please [check out the troubleshooting steps there](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting#Get-started-with-Kaggle-notebooks).
# 
# Two big limitations of LLMs are 1) that they only "know" the information that they were trained on, and 2) that they have limited input context windows. A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:
# 
# 1. Indexing
# 2. Retrieval
# 3. Generation
# 
# Indexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.
# 
# In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. You will use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma, you can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search your documents.
# 
# ## For help
# 
# **Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**

# ## Setup
# 
# First, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.

# %% [code] {"id":"JbXe7Oodc5dP"}
%pip install -U -q "google-generativeai>=0.8.3" chromadb

# %% [markdown]
# You may see output containing `ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed` - this is OK, the packages are still installed and compatible for this codelab. Also note that you do not have to restart the kernel.

# 
# To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a [Kaggle secret](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/114053) named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
# 
# If you don't already have an API key, you can grab one from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). You can find [detailed instructions in the docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
# 
# To make the key available through Kaggle secrets, choose `Secrets` from the `Add-ons` menu and follow the instructions to add your key or enable it for this notebook.

# ### Explore available models
# 
# You will be using the [`embedContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/embeddings#method:-models.embedcontent) API method to calculate embeddings in this guide. Find a model that supports it through the [`models.list`](https://ai.google.dev/api/models#method:-models.list) endpoint. You can also find more information about the embedding models on [the models page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini#text-embedding).
# 
# `text-embedding-004` is the most recent embedding model, so you will use it for this exercise.

# ## Creating the embedding database with ChromaDB
# 
# Create a [custom function](https://docs.trychroma.com/guides/embeddings#custom-embedding-functions) to generate embeddings with the Gemini API. In this task, you are implementing a retrieval system, so the `task_type` for generating the *document* embeddings is `retrieval_document`. Later, you will use `retrieval_query` for the *query* embeddings. Check out the [API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api/embeddings#v1beta.TaskType) for the full list of supported tasks.

# 
# Now that you have found a relevant passage from the set of documents (the *retrieval* step), you can now assemble a generation prompt to have the Gemini API *generate* a final answer. Note that in this example only a single passage was retrieved. In practice, especially when the size of your underlying data is large, you will want to retrieve more than one result and let the Gemini model determine what passages are relevant in answering the question. For this reason it's OK if some retrieved passages are not directly related to the question - this generation step should ignore them.
